# nbaStatsDisplay

This is a repository for displaying NBA stats in different forms. The current roadmap is below. The [NBA_API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) is how the data is collected.

## Roadmap

- [X] Develop a news ticker 
- [ ] Verify possible errors and bugs in the ticker as well as make it x-platform
- [ ] Develop something similar to the ticker but now generating multiple images based on a list of players. Should provide the headshot picture of the players and their stats below (e.g: First to the floor stuff)

## NBA Stats Ticker

This is a stats ticker for podcasts/content creation. As currently built it generates a single "line" ticker with all the players of the selected team and time period. For example for the last 5 games of the *Regular Season* of the Boston Celtics the __per game__ averages where the following:

Which then generated the following:
